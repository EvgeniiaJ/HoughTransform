              Project: Hough Transform
              
You are to implement the Hough Transform for line detection algorithm.  

  Abstract: 

Hough Transform is the best Line Detection Algorithm (self-driving cars use it).
There are two spaces used in Hough Transform: a 2D image space and a 2D Hough Space.
In the 2D image space, one axis is Row, the other axis is Col. Each “cell” of the image
space represents a single pixel.  

In the Hough Space, one axis is Angle and the other axis is Distance (the “orthogonal
distance” from the origin to the lines. Each “cell” of Hough Space represents a “line”
(with the count of co-linear object pixels on the image space.)

Hough Transform is a mapping from “lines” (on the image) to points (on the Hough Space).
All object pixels located on the same line (i.e. co-linear pixels) are mapped (voted) onto
a single bucket [angle, distance] in the Hough Space, where angle is the angle of the line
passing thru these co-linear pixels and distance is the orthogonal distance from the origin
to that line.


I. inFile(args[0] / argv[1]): a binary image 

II. - outFile1 (args[1] / argv[2]): using prettyPrint for visual 
    - outFile_2 (args[2] /  / argv[3]): // the final result of your HoughAry with header information
